 * <p>Whose turn it is is derived ({@link HeartsGame#onClock}), never stored: the leader plus
 * the size of the trick already say it, and a second copy could disagree.
 *
 * @param seats the four seats, in table order; position in this list is the seat
 * @param hand zero-based hand number, which also picks the pass direction
 * @param passes cards chosen for passing this hand; they stay in the hand until the exchange
 * @param leader who led the current trick; null while passing
 * @param handPoints penalty points taken so far this hand
 * @param scores running totals across hands
 * @param history one row per finished hand, the points scored, in seat order
 * @param lastTrick the most recently completed trick, kept so the table can show its last card
